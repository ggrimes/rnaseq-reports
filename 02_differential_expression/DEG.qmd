# Set up

We recommend not to filter before DESeq2 since it will be handling by it. There are cases where pre-filtering could be good:

- large number of drop-outs, to reduce computation
- large number of samples, to reduce computation
- unbalanced groups, many less samples for one group than another, maybe filtering by group is an option.


```{r setup}
# Establish a null DDS object for DESeq2
dds_to_use <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(counts, coldata, design = ~1)

# Perform a variance-stabilized transformation and assign the DESeqTransform object to vsd_before
vsd_before <- vst(dds_to_use)
# Extract the variance-stabilized transformed (normalized) counts and assign them to norm_matrix
norm_matrix <- assay(vsd_before)
```

# PCA and group level variance.

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used to simplify high-dimensional data by identifying patterns and reducing the number of variables. In the context of gene expression, PCA helps analyze large datasets containing information about the expression levels of thousands of genes across different samples (e.g., tissues, cells).**

Dispersion estimates are a key part of the DESEQ2 analysis. DESEQ2 uses data from all samples and all genes to generate a relationship between level expression and variance and then shrinks per gene dispersions to match this distribution. If one group has higher variance than all others this will affect the dispersion estimates. Here we visually check that the variance per group is similar using a PCA. The ellipses are minimal volume enclosing ellipses using the Khachiyan algorithm.

**It is best practice NOT to subset your data unless one group has significantly higher variance than the others. The best dispersion estimates are obtained with more data.**

**This code automatically uses the column value from the header. You can also manually add a factor of interest to define the groups. One can be created by combining multiple metadata columns using the paste0 function.**

```{r set-group, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
## Example of creating a group covariate
# meta$group <- paste0(meta$sex, "_", meta$age, "_", meta$treatment)

# Re-assign the factor of interest in case it has change
# You can modify this to test for different factors of interest with:
# factor_of_interest <- "insert column name for covariate of interest"
factor_of_interest <- column
```

```{r plot-pca}
# Run PCA on the normalized counts
pca <- degPCA(norm_matrix,
  metadata = metrics, # Using the metrics object as our metadata
  condition = factor_of_interest, # Specifying the condition as our factor_of_interest from the above code chunk
  name = "sample", # Column from metadata to use to label the points in the PCA plot
  data = TRUE # Include the data
)

pca$plot + # Create plot
  ggtitle(paste0("All samples", "\nPCA using ", nrow(vsd_before), " genes")) + # Add title to plot
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + # Center title on plot
  geom_mark_ellipse(aes(color = .data[[column]])) + # Create ellipses on plot
  scale_color_grafify("kelly") # Set color parameter for plot
```

## Analysis of the variance by group

Groups in a univariate analysis can also differ with regard to their mean values, variation around those means, or both. In univariate analyses, dispersion can be examined using Levene’s test.  PERMDISP is a multivariate extension of Levene’s test to examine whether groups differ in variability. In essence, PERMDISP involves calculating the distance from each data point to its group centroid and then testing whether those distances differ among the groups. [Source](https://uw.pressbooks.pub/appliedmultivariatestatistics/chapter/permdisp/)

Here we apply this test to our variance stabilized data. We calculate distances between samples and then use the `betadisper()` function from the popular vegan package. We get two overall p-values where significant means that the dispersions are different between groups. The first p-value comes from the `anova()` function and the second from the `permutest()` function. We also get pairwise p-values for every group-group comparison.

```{r PERMDISP}
# Use vegdist() to compute pair-wise dissimilarity indices between samples from the normalized count matrix
# Note, we need to transpose (use t())) the counts matrix for vegdist() to compute dissimilarity indices between the samples
vare.disa <- vegdist(t(assay(vsd_before)))

# Evaluate the homogeneity of dispersion within the groups
mod <- betadisper(vare.disa, group = metrics[[factor_of_interest]])
# Test the homogeniety of dispersion between groups  with ANOVA.
# ANOVA tests is there is overall significant variation in variance between groups.
anova(mod)
# Test the homogeniety of dispersion between groups  with a permutation test
# The permutation test considers pairwise comparisons so you can see which group(s) is different
permutest(mod, pairwise = TRUE)
```


# Covariate analysis

Multiple factors related to the experimental design or quality of sequencing may influence the outcomes of a given RNA-seq experiment. To further determine whether any confounding covariate risks affecting the results of our differential expression analyses, it is useful to assess the correlation between covariates and principal component (PC) values.

Here, we are using `DEGreport::degCovariates()` to explore potential correlations between variables provided in the metadata and all PCs that account for at least 5% of the variability in the data. If applicable, significant correlations (FDR < 0.1) are circled. **This diagnostic plot helps us determine which variables we may need to add to our DE model.**


```{r run-covariates, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 10}
# Visualize covariates for the PCs
degCovariates(
  counts = norm_matrix, # Normalized counts matrix
  metadata = metrics # Metadata to overlay as covariates
)
```

# Data modeling

```{r setup-deseq2}
# Enter your design formula
# The format should be:
# as.formula(paste0("~ ", column_to_control_for, " + ", factor_of_interest))
formula <- as.formula(paste0("~ ", " + ", column))
# Stop if the column names in counts does not match and in the same order as the row names in metrics
stopifnot(all(colnames(counts) == rownames(coldata)))

# Create the DDS object for DESeq2 and assign it to the object dds_to_use
dds_to_use <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(
  countData = counts, # Provide the raw counts data
  colData = coldata, # Provide the metadata
  design = formula # Provide the design formula
)

# Carry out a variance-stabilized transformation of the data in the DDS object and assign it to vsd_before
# Note: vsd_before and norm_matrix was previously assigned in the setup code chunk  w/o variables in the formula so this is overwriting that
# NOTE: VST won’t regress out this when normalizing
vsd_before <- vst(dds_to_use)
# Extract the variance-stabilized transformed (normalized) counts and assign them to norm_matrix
norm_matrix <- assay(vsd_before)
# We are going to modify coldata in the RUV section when is turn on, hence want to retain the original
new_cdata <- coldata
```

For this study, this formula is  recommended: `r as.character(formula)`

```{r note-ruv, eval=F, echo=FALSE}

```

## Remove unwanted variation

Removing unwanted variation from RNA-seq analysis is essential to ensure that the results reflect biological rather than technical differences. Methods like ComBat, RUVseq, or surrogate variable analysis (SVA) can be applied to adjust for batch effects, library preparation discrepancies, or other confounders. These techniques model and subtract the unwanted variation, enhancing the ability to detect true biological signals in the data. Proper normalization and careful experimental design are also crucial steps to mitigate such unwanted variation.

### Assessing unknown factors

```{r note-ruv-print, results='asis'}
# Print out text discussing is RUVseq will be done
# If the RUV parameter in the params section of the YAML is TRUE, then
if (run_ruv) {
  cat("When performing differential expression analysis, it is important to ensure that any detected differences are truly a result of the experimental comparison being made and not any additional variability in the data.")
} else { # If the RUV parameter in the params section of the YAML is FALSE, then
  cat("There is no need to assess unknown factor for this study.")
}
```

```{r do_RUV, eval=run_ruv, echo=run_ruv}
# TOFIX Add to template: check correlation of dummy variables produced by ruvseq with existing covariates in metadata
# NOTE: RUVseq is used when you don’t know where the unwanted variation is coming from. The package utilizes dummy variable(s), 1-5 used, start with 1, look at PCA, decide if you want more separation. Add any known-created RUV variables to DESeq2 formula. The normalized matrix produced – only for visualization, not for input into DESeq2.
library(RUVSeq)

# If you want to skip the code, just set up formula to be your model in the next chunk of code

dds_to_use <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(counts, new_cdata, design = formula)
# Apply VST
vsd_to_use <- vst(dds_to_use, blind = FALSE)
```

### Remove Batch Effects

```{r combat-text , eval=run_combatseq, results='asis', echo=run_combatseq}
# NOTE Combatseq (part of the SVA package) - corrected count, removes the effects while retaining the structure of the data. Used in a scenario where you know what covariate/batch is. Do not add known-removed covariates to DESeq2 formula. Also, don’t attempt to remove biological effect (e.g. donor), this is not conceptually valid; best for technical variation.
library(sva)

cat("Here we apply Combat-seq (https://github.com/zhangyuqing/ComBat-seq) to try to remove batch effects so we can better tease out the effects of interest.
Combat-seq uses a negative binomial regression to model batch effects, providing adjusted data by mapping the original data to an expected distribution if there were no batch effects. The adjusted data preserves the integer nature of counts, so that it is compatible with the assumptions of state-of-the-art differential expression software (e.g. edgeR, DESeq2, which specifically request untransformed count data).")
```

```{r print-no-ruv-or-batch, eval=!run_combatseq, results='asis', echo=run_combatseq}
cat("There is no need to remove known factors like batch effect in this study.")
```

```{r set_variable_combatseq, eval=run_combatseq, echo=run_combatseq}

# Differential Expression

Differential gene expression analysis of count data was performed using the Bioconductor R package, DESeq2, which fits the count data to a negative binomial model. 

Before fitting the model, we often look at a metric called dispersion, which is a measure for variance which also takes into consideration mean expression. A dispersion value is estimated for each individual gene, then 'shrunken' to a more accurate value based on expected variation for a typical gene exhibiting that level of expression. Finally, the shrunken dispersion value is used in the final GLM fit. 

We use the below dispersion plot, which should show an inverse relationship between dispersion and mean expression, to get an idea of whether our data is a good fit for the model. 

```{r run-deseq2}
# Perform differential expression analysis on the DDS object
de <- DESeq(dds_to_use)
# Plot the dispersion for the data
DESeq2::plotDispEsts(de)

Because it is difficult to accurately detect and quantify the expression of lowly expressed genes, differences in their expression between treatment conditions can be unduly exaggerated after the model is fit. We correct for this so that gene LFC is not dependent overall on basal gene expression level.

In cases there are multiple groups and conditions across groups is recommended to use dummy variables instead of interaction terms: https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#interactions.

The LRT is useful for testing multiple terms at once, for example testing 3 or more levels of a factor at once, or all interactions between two variables. The LRT for count data is conceptually similar to an analysis of variance (ANOVA) calculation in linear regression, except that in the case of the Negative Binomial GLM, we use an analysis of deviance (ANODEV), where the deviance captures the difference in likelihood between a full and a reduced model.

## MA plot

This plot can help to:

- Identify Differential Expression: Genes that show a significant log-fold change (M value away from 0) indicate changes in expression between conditions.
- Assess Data Quality: The plot can help in identifying biases or systematic errors in the data. Ideally, most points should scatter around the M=0 line, indicating that there is no significant systematic difference between the conditions.
- Visualize data dispersion: The distribution of points along the A-axis gives a sense of the spread of expression levels and any patterns or anomalies in the dataset.

## Volcano plot

This volcano plot shows the genes that are significantly up- and down-regulated as a result of the analysis comparison. The points highlighted in purple are genes that have padj < 0.05 and a log2-fold change > 0.5. Points in pink have a padj < 0.05 and a log2-fold change < 0.5 and points in blue have a padj > 0.05 and a log2-fold change > 0.5. Grey points are non-significant. The dashed lines correspond to the cutoff values of log2 foldchange and padj that we have chosen.

# Pathway Analysis- GSEA

Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is a computational method used to determine whether a predefined set of genes shows statistically significant, concordant differences between two biological states (e.g., disease vs. normal) in RNA-seq data or other types of gene expression data. Advantages of GSEA.

- Biological Insight: Helps in understanding the underlying biological processes and pathways affected, rather than focusing on individual genes.
- Incorporation of Prior Knowledge: Utilizes predefined gene sets, allowing integration of existing biological knowledge.
- Contextual Relevance: Can reveal subtle but coordinated changes in biologically meaningful gene sets that might not be apparent when looking at individual genes.

```{r run-gsea, warning=F, message=F, eval=run_FA}

    filter(!is.na(padj)) %>% # Remove any adjusted p-values that are NA, but there should be since they were filtered when making the de_list object
    dplyr::select(gene_id, lfc) # Extract the columns "gene_id" and "lfc"
  # Obtain the ENSEMBL ID and gene symbols for the genes in the gsea_input object

# Pathway Analysis- Over-representation

Over-Representation Analysis (ORA) is a statistical method used to determine whether a predefined set of genes (e.g., genes belonging to a specific biological pathway or function) is over-represented (or enriched) among a list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from RNA-seq data. Adventages of ORA:

- Simplicity: Easy to perform and interpret.
- Biological Insight: Helps to identify pathways and processes that are significantly affected in the condition studied.
- Prior Knowledge Integration: Utilizes existing biological knowledge through predefined gene sets.

If you would like to use `DEGpatterns.Rmd` template to visualize trends of gene changes across conditions/groups, please save the following output:

```{r save}
# Save the DESeq object to an RDS file
saveRDS(dds_to_use, "DEGpattern_deseq_obj.rds")
# Save the metadata to an RDS file
saveRDS(coldata, "deseq_coldata.rds")

# Set the adjusted p-value threshold to 0.05
padj.cutoff <- 0.05
# Assign a value for the top n genes to XXX
topN <- 1000

# Go through each contrast in the de_list list object and extract the significance values for the significant genes for top N significant genes
# This will go through the de_list object, assign the name of the contrast in the de_list to contrast and assign its associated differential expression list (containing lfc, lfcs, all and sig) to the object contrast_de
deg_List <- imap(de_list, \(contrast_de, contrast){
  # Extract the significant genes from a given contrast and assign them to res_LRT
  res_LRT <- contrast_de[["sig"]]
  # Create a named vector where the values in the vector are the adjusted p-values and the names are the index of the value
  gene_padj <- setNames(res_LRT$padj, rownames(res_LRT))
  # Subset the gene_padj vector by the adjusted p-value threshold established in the top of this code block
  gene_sig <- gene_padj[gene_padj < padj.cutoff]
  # Arrange the gene significance values with the most significant first (they should already be arranged this way though), then keep either the first N genes defined by topN at the top of this code block or the total number of significant genes, whichever is fewer and assign it to the object called degs
  degs <- sort(gene_sig)[1:min(length(gene_sig), topN)]
  # Save the RDS object for the significance values for a given contrast, adjusted p-value threshold and number of top N genes

# Please note, you can choose to combine all significant results across contrast as well
